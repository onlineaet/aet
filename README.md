"AET" has been developed for two years. It is a programming language that looks like an object, 
is compatible with C language, has simple syntax, is flexible and extensible, 
like C + +, ADA, objc and so on in GCC platform.

"AET" contains almost all the features of object-oriented programming languages, 
supports generic programming (substitution and virtualization) and syntax stage optimization. 
When using C language, it is very difficult to use object-oriented theory and method for complex programming. With "AET", 
we can enjoy the simplicity and efficiency brought by C language, and at the same time, we can also use
The complex software is constructed by using the programming method of surface object.
